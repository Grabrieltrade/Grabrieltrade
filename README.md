---> here as y'all know how we are going to do it 
Trading level. 

Trading level strategy 

•we are going to make our position more safety as we all do trading to make our account more profitable each day. 

•we are going to trade levels each levels should be trim or TP. Each day we are going to choose 2 stocks at open and we are going to make our level to play each day. 


•each stock will have a stop loss too, and will be so closer to our enter price. 


•we are going to choose 3 level, first our enter price, 2 level going to be trim, last one we are going to be out. 


•everyone should follow this rules and we are going to make our account more safety risk. This strategy won’t be here for long this is a serious issue that everyone have already. This will probe everyone how to manage your position. 
By the end I will have a vote 🗳 if should I continue or not everyone will vote. 

•we are going to trade stocks that low volume each day. Here they are $NIO, $NVDA, $AAPL and last $AMD
